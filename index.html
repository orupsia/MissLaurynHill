                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Lauryn Noelle Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. She is recognized by music critics as one of the most influential musical artists of her time. Hill is credited with breaking barriers for female rappers, contributing to the mainstream success of both hip-hop and neo soul, and blending rap with melodic vocals. She has been named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR, and one of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. In 2015, Billboard ranked her the greatest female rapper. Among her accolades are eight Grammy Awards—the most for any female rapper. "Doo Wop (That Thing)" became Hill's first and only US Billboard Hot 100 number one hit. It marked the first US number one written, produced and recorded by one sole woman since Debbie Gibson's "Lost in Your Eyes" (1989). It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first hip hop song by a soloist to debut at number one, and the first debut single to premiere atop the chart. It also marked the first song by a female rapper to peak at number one on the Hot 100, and remained the only solo song by a female rapper to debut at number one for more two decades.</p>

            <p>Fugees are an American hip-hop group formed in South Orange, New Jersey, in 1990. The trio of Wyclef Jean, Pras Michel, and Lauryn Hill became known for their fusion of hip-hop, reggae, R&B, and funk, socially conscious lyrics, and use of live instrumentation. The Fugees' second album, The Score (1996), peaked at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and stayed in the top ten of that chart for over half a year. Singles from The Score included "Fu-Gee-La" and "Ready or Not", which highlighted Hill's singing and rapping abilities.</p>

                <h5>~Solo Time~</h5>
                <p>In 1998, Hill released her debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The album was a critical and commercial success, earning her five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. It featured hit singles such as "Doo Wop (That Thing)" and "Ex-Factor". The album's blend of hip-hop, soul, and R&B, along with its introspective lyrics, solidified Hill's status as a groundbreaking artist. However, after the success of her debut album, Hill faced legal and personal challenges that led to a hiatus from music. She released a live album in 2002 and a compilation of unreleased tracks in 2007, but has not released a full studio album since.</p>
